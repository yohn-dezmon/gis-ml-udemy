# Supervised and Unsupervised Learning in GIS 

Topics:
- image classification 
- supervised and unsupervised classification 
- examples 

Image Classification 
- the most commonly used ML in GIS
- automated approach for classifying raster images 
- uses multispectral (and other GIS data) as input 
- separate different classes based on pattern recognition 
- each pixel is assigned to particular theme or 'class' 

An agricultural land use map can be determined using the Random Forest Algorithm.  

Unsupervised:
- defined number of classes
- statistical methods to separate data values
- often first step of classification 
- analyst has no control 
- e.g. K-means

Supervised:
- User determines test areas 
-
